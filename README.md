# Repository of React Technology Experiments

This repository contains various experiments that utilize different React technologies to practice different functionalities. Below are descriptions of two of the topics that have been covered.

| #   | Topic                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| 1   | Routing using React Context | This experiment utilized routing in React using context. Instead of using an external routing library like React Router, a custom context was created that allows child components to access routing information such as the current URL and navigation history. This approach has the advantage of customizing routing to fit the specific needs of the project, without having to add an additional library.                                            |
| 2   | Getting Started with Redux  | This experiment used Redux to manage application state. Redux is a state management library commonly used in React projects. It provides a clear solution for maintaining the global state of the application and makes handling state changes easier. In this experiment, a simple application was created that uses Redux to manage the state of a counter. Application components connect to the Redux store and access state data through properties. |
